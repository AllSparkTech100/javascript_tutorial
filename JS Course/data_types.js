// Data Types and Variables
// (in computer science) Data is anything that is meaningful to the computer.
/* Undefined = something that has not been defined.

Null = simply say nothing.

Boolean = a true or false statement.

String =

Symbol = an immutable value that is unique.

Number = a number

Object = can store a lot of key value types.
*/


//Declaring Variables
/* using 

var myName = this variable will be used throughout the whole program.

let ourName = will be used within where it was declared.

const pi = a variable that can never change.
 */


//Assigning Variable
//e.g
var a; Declaring
var b = 2; Assigning using the assignment operator {=}

//console.log allows you see things in the console.


/* Addition of Numbers*/
var sum = 12 + 12;
console.log (sum);

Subtraction
var difference = 12 - 12;
console.log (difference);

Division
var quotient = 12 / 12;
console.log (quotient);

Multiplication
var product = 12 * 12;
console.log (product);



Incrementing
var myVar = 87;
myVar = myVar++;


Decrementing
var myVar = 87;
myVar = myVar--;


Decimal Numbers (Floating point nnumbers)
var decimal = 5.7

Looking for remainder

var remainder = 11 % 3;
remainder operator use to check if a number is odd or even.

Augmented addition, multiplication, subtraction and division
var a = 3;
var b = 4;

a +=23;
b +=12;

a *=2;
b *=3;

a -=1;
b -=3;

a /=2;
b /=3;

// String Variable

var firstName = "Alan"
var lastName = "Alaner"

var myStr = "firstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"
